Privacy Policy for Listaa

Last Updated: 12 July 2025

Thank you for choosing Listaa. Your privacy is extremely important to us, and we are committed to protecting your personal information and ensuring transparency in how our app works. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we do or do not collect, how we use your device's permissions, and how your data is stored and protected.
1. Information We Do NOT Collect

Listaa is designed to respect your privacy by default. We want to reassure you that:

    We do NOT collect any personal information, such as your name, email, contacts, or location.

    We do NOT transmit or share any data to external servers.

    All features in Listaa are fully functional offline, without requiring an internet connection.

    We do NOT use cloud backup, analytics, or data tracking of any kind.

Your data belongs only to you and remains securely stored on your own device.
2. Permissions We Request and Why

To enable certain features, Listaa may request access to specific device permissions. We only ask for the minimum permissions needed to offer full app functionality:

    Camera Access: Only used when you choose to scan a QR code to import data. No images or video are recorded or stored.

    Photos / Media / Files: Only used when you manually share, import, or export QR-related content. We do not access or upload your media files.

    Notifications: Needed to schedule and send reminders within the app. These notifications are fully local.

    Background Tasks: Allows the app to run reminder notifications even when you’re not using it.

    Internet / URL Launcher: Only triggered when you choose to open external links such as email support or developer profiles. The app does not make automatic internet requests.

We never use any permission to collect, monitor, or send personal data.
3. How We Handle Your Data

Listaa stores all your app data, including:

    Shopping lists

    Product names

    QR codes

...locally on your device. This means:

    Your data is never uploaded to a server or shared with others automatically.

    You are in full control of what you save, delete, or export.

    If you choose to share a QR code, it is done manually by you.

There is no online account system, no login, and no syncing with external platforms.
4. Data Security & Your Control

While we do not handle or store your data, we highly recommend:

    Using your device's built-in security features like screen lock, PIN code, or fingerprint to protect your data from unauthorized access.

    Only sharing QR codes or screenshots with people you trust, as this may contain your saved information.

Remember, all data remains offline, which reduces the risk of any external breaches.
5. Third-Party Services

To further ensure your privacy, Listaa does not integrate with any third-party services. Specifically:

    No advertising SDKs

    No Google Analytics or Firebase Analytics

    No crash reporting tools

    No hidden trackers

This means your usage behavior is not being monitored or used for commercial or marketing purposes.
6. Children’s Privacy

Listaa is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, process, or store data from children. If we discover that the app has been used by someone under this age, we encourage parents or guardians to remove the app or supervise its use.
7. Policy Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect app changes or legal requirements. When we do, the "Last Updated" date will be revised accordingly. We encourage you to review this page from time to time for any changes.

Your continued use of the app after any updates to this policy indicates your acceptance of the changes.
